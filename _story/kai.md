text: Delicate, organic components catch fire in Kai Wai Wongâ€™s photo series.
  Subtly hedonic, his images sequence a process of ignition, burning, and
  flickering back down to a smolder, and in the end we are left to examine what
  the scorch has left behind.
quote: I desire to see the destruction of beauty.
