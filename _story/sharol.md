  Quiet oddities pervade Sharol Xiaoâ€™s self-portraiture. Entwining nostalgia, mischief, and taboo, she escapes the boredom and restraints of daily life to her photographic compositions, seeking freedom and the full spectrum of herself. We are invited on this journey through her softly penetrating gaze but each snapshot is a pure exploration of the self, untainted by spectator appetites.
