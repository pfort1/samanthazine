  Visual artist Sean Smith’s kitschy collages engage in obscenity with humor and wit. Sometimes colorful, sometimes monochromatic, always chaotic and absurd. Although he works in 2D, his maximalist, multi-layered creations boast a sculptural weight.
quote: Many people fantasize that the world has a light side and a dark side. Sometimes it’s just simply odd.
