  Despondent in love, Pawel Woznicki’s mixed-media series confronts anxieties of vulnerability through a deeply personal, finite perspective. Vigorous strokes of black and red crayon layered upon intimate photographs convey intense emotions and ask: what do we owe one another? 
quote: I drawn into you, but you didn’t come and save me like you promise me before.
